UNICEF was already concerned about the impact of the “Lost Decade” of the 1980s on children, which was characterized by the debt crisis and was followed by structural adjustments in many developing countries. Fretting the additional consequences of the unprecedented social transformation in the transition economies for children, UNICEF started a research programme called “Impact of Transition”, later TransMonEE."

Therefore, in an attempt to affect the policies and programmes on children. Thus, what was initiated as a programme to monitor transition (Transition Monitoring in Eastern Europe) has become a programme to monitor the situation of children who face inequities in the realization of their rights enshrined in the Convention on the Rights of the Child (Transformative Monitoring for Enhanced Equity)."

The TransMonEE data represent a particularly useful tool for governments, civil society organizations, donors, and academia in considering their decisions, policies, programmes, and agendas. The database is updated in two ways. Firstly, every year thanks to National Statistical Offices (NSOs) collaboration, country-specific data collection templates are shared with the NSOs, filled in, and submitted by the countries by the end-September with the data for the previous year. Secondly, planned indicators/data are fetch using SDMX data classification structure through open data APIs from several international databases. This work is in progress. Still August 2021, 310 indicators data over years pulled into regional TransMonEE database."
